								<p>Although this market is much smaller than the one in downtown Berkeley, it arguably had more types of food. Of course there was the regular produce and meats, but there were also pretzels, honey, iced tea, oysters, and even some small restaurants and food trucks were parked there. Again, all of these items were placed on tables in almost makeshift-looking containers, which seem a lot less industrial than what is found in a store.</p>
