								<p>Now that I was in familiar territory again, I wanted to study the arrangement and products on grocery store shelves, armed with the experience of a farmers market.</p>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/blog5/IMG_1981.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>After taking note of how the items at the farmers markets were arranged, something that Ryan and Zoe from the other say said really struck with me. Farmers markets have no map - there’s an organized madness to the layout since there’s no set areas for specific types of food. That fact makes sense since those stalls are effectively competing against each other.<br><br>In the case of a brick and mortar grocery store, however, all of the products assembled inside are sold by the same company, and often the same single person. A notable difference between the foods on display here, and in the farmers markets, is that in the store they’re all recognizable brands: Skippy, Nutella, Coca Cola, etc. One thing that came to me from the course was to look through the different brands of one type of product: drinks for example. Indeed, almost all of them were owned by Coca Cola, which really honed in on the “illusion of choice” we have at grocery stores.</p>
								<span class="image right"><img src="images/blog5/IMG_1986.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>There isn’t much to stop and look at besides the food, so often customers would spend not even 10 minutes getting their food, bringing it to the register, and leaving. Similarly to the demographics of the farmers markets, the customers that I noticed here are made of a wide variety of ethnic, racial, and age groups.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
