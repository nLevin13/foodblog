								<p>Although this market is much smaller than the one in downtown Berkeley, it arguably had more types of food. Of course there was the regular produce and meats, but there were also pretzels, honey, iced tea, oysters, and even some small restaurants and food trucks were parked there. Again, all of these items were placed on tables in almost makeshift-looking containers, which seem a lot less industrial than what is found in a store.<br><br>One thing that I hadn’t thought about until I visited this second farmers market is how attending one market per week isn’t enough for most of the vendors. This occurred to me when I found many of the same vendors here that I found in the Downtown Berkeley Market.</p>

								<p>Hyper Local Honey is a beekeeping farm located, well, “hyper local”, and they sell their honey as well as candles at their stall. I got to speak with the wife of the head of the farm, Kate Weiss, who has been working in this industry for seven years. She loves it so much that she kept working even after her formal retirement. She also echoed a common theme with a lot of the vendors at both markets, stating that she loves selling to her customers directly, getting to interact with them on a personal level. She emphasized the importance of honey as a substitute for many allergens and thus is a very beneficial food to sell. She takes part in a bit of bee-saving activism as well, making sure to speak about the dying bee population with her customers.<br><br>In the picture to the left, their candles, honey jars, and actual bees can bee seen.</p>

								<p>Linda, who works with Great Valley Poultry, loves her customers. Her favorite part of the job is, also, speaking to them, often not even about her eggs that she’s selling. She sometimes works on the farm with the chickens, but she mostly devotes her time to her job as a vendor and she knows a lot of her regular customers on a personal level.<br><br>I can’t even remember the name of my roomates.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
